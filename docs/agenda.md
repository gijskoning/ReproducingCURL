### Week 2 (26-04-2021)
- Introduction with TA 
- Propose CURL paper 

### Week 3 (03-05-2021)
- CURL is an improvement on Pixel SAC. Would it be good to also implement the baseline? It is mostly swapping the first couple of CNN layers.
- Currently we have copied the utility classes and training structure from the original repo. Is this okay to do?
